       <h3 className="mern"> As a Middleware:</h3>
         Express has a powerful middleware system 
        that allows you to execute code before, after, or in 
        the middle of processing a request. This is useful for
         tasks like authentication, logging, parsing data, anderror handling.
         <br />

           <h3 className="mern">As a Routing: </h3>
            Express simplifies route handling. You can 
          define routes for different URL paths and HTTP methods,
           making it easy to create RESTful APIs and handle various
            client requests.
